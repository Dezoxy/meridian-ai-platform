#
#   render-mermaid.sh <dir>
#
# Each <dir>/<name>.mmd becomes <dir>/<name>.png (scale 2, white background)
# with the pinned Mermaid CLI image. `make mermaid-render` uses it to prove
# that every Mermaid block in the Markdown parses, which GitHub would otherwise
# only show as an error box on the pushed page; architecture-pdf.sh uses it to
# make the images Pandoc needs.
#
# One container per file, so a failure names its file. Every file is tried and
# the exit status is 1 if any failed. A failure prints the file and, when
# <dir>/index.tsv (hash, Markdown file, line; written by
# `mermaid_blocks.py extract`) exists, where the diagram came from, then the
# renderer's own message. A folder with no .mmd files is not an error.
#
#   MERMAID_IMAGE  required: the pinned Mermaid CLI image, e.g.
#                  minlag/mermaid-cli:11.17.0 (~630 MB). Keep it identical to
#                  the Makefile's pin.
#
# The container runs as you, so the folder needs no chmod and the PNGs are
# yours. HOME=/tmp because the browser inside keeps a cache there and the user
# has no home directory.
