"""Assemble a Structurizr Documentation tab into one Markdown file for Pandoc.

Structurizr's Documentation tab is the Markdown files in the directory named
by `!docs` in workspace.dsl, joined in filename order, with
`![](embed:ViewKey)` lines showing views inline. This does the same for print:

- joins the files and replaces every embed with the PNG exported for that view;
  a diagram at least LANDSCAPE_RATIO times wider than tall gets its own
  landscape page;
- normalises headings so the top level used becomes level 1, whether the files
  use `#` or `##` for their sections;
- appends a "Decisions" section with every ADR the workspace imports with
  `!adrs`, in number order, each on its own page;
- appends the Markdown files listed in an optional `pdf-sections.txt` in the
  architecture directory (one path per line, relative to that directory; `#`
  starts a comment), for documents outside the Documentation tab such as a
  risk register;
- turns every Mermaid diagram into an image: a ```mermaid fence in a page,
  ADR or extra section, or the image link Structurizr's Mermaid plugin
  rewrites a fence into (`![](<mermaid.url>/svg/<base64url of the source>)`,
  or `pako:` plus the compressed source when `mermaid.compress` is on). The
  prefix is `mermaid.url` from the workspace JSON; without it no link is
  touched. The source lands in generated/mermaid-pdf/<sha12>.mmd and the text
  gets `![](generated/mermaid-pdf/<sha12>.png)`; scripts/render-mermaid.sh
  makes the PNGs before Pandoc runs. A link that cannot be decoded stops the
  build, because Pandoc would fetch it or fail on it and the PDF would ship a
  hole. Diagrams get no landscape page: the size caps below fit them;
- turns links to repository files into plain text, because on paper they lead
  nowhere; web links and in-page anchors stay links;
- prints tables for paper (pdf_tables.py): one with a cell too long for a
  table row prints as records, a block of paragraphs per row, because LaTeX
  cannot break a row and loses what runs off the page; any other wide table
  gets its column widths from its text;
- appends a "Views" section with every view that the text does not embed, so
  the PDF shows the whole model even when the pages embed nothing;
- writes a YAML header for the Eisvogel cover (project, date, edition) and
  contents page.

With `--brief` it writes the brief instead, the edition to hand to someone who
will not read a register: the same pages without the documents listed in an
optional `pdf-brief.txt` (one path per line, relative to the architecture
directory, a page of the Documentation tab or the file its symlink points at;
`#` starts a comment), the decisions as an index of number, title, status and
date, no extra sections, and every view. Its first page says what it leaves
out, so that a brief without a threat model is never read as a system without
one. Its file name has `-brief` after `architecture`.

Views come from Structurizr's JSON export, not from parsing the DSL, so their
keys, titles and descriptions are exactly what Structurizr sees. The edition is
the last commit that touched the architecture directory, marked when it has
uncommitted changes. The script prints the PDF file name to use, which carries
the same identity as the cover: <project>-architecture-<date>-<edition>.pdf,
with -dirty after the commit when the docs have uncommitted changes.

The generated directory sits inside the architecture directory and holds the
PNG export (`export -format png`) and the JSON export (`export -format json`,
workspace.json) of the same workspace. Image paths in the output are relative
to the architecture directory, so run Pandoc from there.

The canonical copy lives in development-base (scripts/); repositories copy it
unchanged and wrap it in their own command.

Usage:
    build_architecture_pdf_source.py <architecture-dir> <generated-dir> <output.md>
        [--brief]
