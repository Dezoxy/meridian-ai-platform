# Local platform on kind

`make up` builds the local Meridian platform on a one-node kind cluster from
pinned Helm charts. `make smoke` proves it works. `make deploy` puts the six
Meridian services on it (Claims API, Agent Runtime, Model Gateway and the
policy, claims and knowledge tool servers), seeds the policy store and ingests
the policy wordings; `make demo` runs a claim through them. `make down`
removes it.
Status: **implemented** (S006, S041 for deploy and demo, S044 for the tool
servers, S043 for the cost dashboard). Nothing here is deployed anywhere but
your laptop; the Azure side is S007 onward. The services run in replay mode:
no model is called, the model's
text is canned and simulated, and so are the embeddings. A triage that asks
the model its one question therefore gets no usable answer and goes to an
adjuster; the rules decide every other claim.

## What `make up` creates

| Component | Chart | Chart version | Namespace |
|---|---|---|---|
| Envoy Gateway (Gateway API edge) | `oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm` | v1.9.2 | `envoy-gateway-system` |
| CloudNativePG operator | `cloudnative-pg` | 0.29.1 (operator 1.30.1) | `cnpg-system` |
| PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector (`platform-db`) | `cluster` | 0.8.1 | `meridian` |
| Prometheus, Grafana, kube-state-metrics, node-exporter | `kube-prometheus-stack` | 91.8.2 (Grafana chart 13.2.7) | `observability` |
| Tempo (traces) | `tempo` | 3.1.0 | `observability` |
| Loki (logs) | `loki` | 18.13.7 | `observability` |
| OpenTelemetry Collector | `opentelemetry-collector` | 0.174.0 (collector 0.161.0) | `observability` |

Every version and image digest is in [`pins.env`](pins.env), the only place
to change one. The values that override chart defaults are in
[`values/`](values/); the Gateway, the namespaces and Grafana's Role are in
[`manifests/`](manifests/).

How telemetry flows: an application sends OTLP to
`otel-collector.observability:4317` (gRPC) or `:4318` (HTTP). The collector
forwards traces to Tempo, metrics to Prometheus's OTLP receiver and logs to
Loki's OTLP endpoint. Grafana has three datasources with fixed uids:
`prometheus`, `tempo` and `loki`. Retention is 24 hours everywhere.

Grafana reads ConfigMaps in its own namespace and nothing else (S043). The
chart's defaults let its dashboard sidecar watch every namespace, which gave
Grafana's service account a ClusterRole to read every ConfigMap and Secret
in the cluster, the database roles' passwords among them, and the chart's
namespaced Role would still add Secrets. So the chart creates no RBAC for
Grafana; [`manifests/grafana-rbac.yaml`](manifests/grafana-rbac.yaml) gives
it a Role in `observability` that reads ConfigMaps only, and both sidecars
watch that namespace only (threat model T-68). `make smoke` checks it.

`make up` also provisions the dashboards in [`dashboards/`](dashboards/), one
ConfigMap each in `observability` (below).

The database is a CloudNativePG `Cluster` named `platform-db` with one
instance and 2 Gi of storage. CloudNativePG generates the `app` credentials
(Secret `platform-db-app` in `meridian`); nothing is set by hand. The `vector`
extension is enabled declaratively by a `Database` resource. The image ships
PostgreSQL 17.11 with pgvector 0.8.6 (read from the image on 2026-10-02).

For the walking skeleton `make up` also declares a second database,
`meridian`, owned by the role `meridian_owner`, and six more roles:
`claims_api`, `agent_runtime`, `model_gateway`, for the tool servers (S013)
`policy_mcp` and `claims_mcp`, and for the knowledge server (S046)
`knowledge_mcp`. All seven can log in and nothing more (no superuser, createdb
or createrole). The three tool-server roles may each hold at most 20
connections: a tool server runs at most eight calls at once, one connection
each and one more for a failure's audit row, and during a rollout two of its
pods run side by side; a runaway server cannot use up PostgreSQL's 100. The
other roles have no such bound until they get a connection pool (S019). The `app`
database, role and Secret are untouched. The `meridian` database declares the
`vector` extension too (S012): migration 0005 needs it, and `meridian_owner`
cannot create an extension PostgreSQL does not trust. `make up` waits until
the operator reports the database applied, which includes the extension, and
`make deploy` refuses to start before that, so the migration never runs
first; `make smoke` looks for the extension in both databases. Each role's
password is in a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` in `meridian`, with
the keys `username`, `password` and `uri`: `meridian-owner-db`,
`claims-api-db`, `agent-runtime-db`, `model-gateway-db`, `policy-mcp-db`,
`claims-mcp-db` and `knowledge-mcp-db`. `make up` creates a Secret only if
it is absent, before the
`platform-db` release installs (CloudNativePG cannot reconcile a role whose
Secret is missing), from `openssl rand -hex 24`. The password goes to `kubectl`
on stdin; it is never an argument, never in a file and never printed. The `uri`
names `platform-db-rw.meridian.svc`, which is in the server certificate, and
asks for `sslmode=verify-full`. To read one, which you rarely need:

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig infra/kind/kubeconfig --context kind-meridian \
  -n meridian get secret claims-api-db -o jsonpath='{.data.uri}' | base64 -d
```

Rotating a password is the owner's call and `make up` never overwrites a
Secret. Both `password` and `uri` (it embeds the password) must change
together, CloudNativePG then applies the new password to the role, and the
Deployment that uses the role must restart to read it; the Jobs read the
owner's Secret afresh on every `make deploy`:

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig infra/kind/kubeconfig --context kind-meridian -n meridian \
  rollout restart deploy/claims-api deploy/agent-runtime deploy/model-gateway \
  deploy/policy-mcp deploy/claims-mcp deploy/knowledge-mcp
```

PostgreSQL itself enforces the database boundary, with `pg_hba` rules in
[`values/platform-db.yaml`](values/platform-db.yaml) that CloudNativePG places
before its default catch-all, after its own local, replication and pooler
rules: a connection without TLS is rejected; the seven roles may log in to
`meridian` over TLS with a SCRAM password and to no other database; no other
role may log in to `meridian`. A client that asks for `sslmode=disable`, or a
service that is pointed at the `app` or `postgres` database, is refused by the
server, whatever its connection string says.

The edge is a Gateway API `Gateway` named `edge` (class `envoy`) with one HTTP
listener. Only routes from the `meridian` namespace may attach. `make deploy`
adds one route, for the Claims API only (below); every other host and path
answers 404.

## Prerequisites

Docker (running), `kind`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `openssl` and `jq`. `make smoke`
and `make demo` also need `curl`. Tested with:

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| kind | v0.33.0 (node image Kubernetes v1.36.4) |
| helm | v4.3.0 |
| kubectl | v1.37.0 |
| Docker Desktop | 4.93.0 (engine 29.8.1), 7.65 GiB memory |

Give Docker at least 6 GiB. The first `make up` downloads about 30 images (the
node image, Kubernetes components and the platform).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make up` | Create the cluster if absent, install every release and provision the Grafana dashboards. Safe to rerun; it converges. Took 4 to 5 minutes from no cluster (245 s and 304 s, images already local), under a minute after. |
| `make deploy` | Needs `make up`. Builds the image, loads it into the node, runs the migration and seed Jobs, applies the manifests in `manifests/meridian/`, ingests the wordings once per image and waits for the six Deployments and the route. Safe to rerun. The first deploy of an image waits a minute after the ingestion (below). |
| `make demo` | Runs `make deploy`, then posts a synthetic claim and finds its trace in Tempo. Prints PASS only when the trace has spans from the five services that triage a claim. |
| `make smoke` | One PASS, FAIL or SKIP line per check; exits non-zero on any FAIL. |
| `make grafana` | Port-forward Grafana to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. User `admin`. |
| `make grafana-password` | Print the Grafana admin password. |
| `make down` | Delete the `meridian` cluster and its credentials file. Destructive; refuses any other cluster name. |

`make smoke` checks five things:

1. **Edge.** `curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/` returns 404, and Envoy's own
   request counter went up. That covers laptop, kind port mapping, NodePort
   and Envoy.
2. **Database.** `pg_extension` lists `vector` in the `app` database and in
   the `meridian` database.
3. **Tools.** One call per tool server through the runtime's own client, run
   inside the Agent Runtime's pod (`python -m meridian.runtime.toolprobe`), so
   with the addresses the runtime itself was given. The call names a run that
   does not exist, and every server must refuse it as `unknown-run`. That
   proves the address, the name lookup, the server's Host allowlist, the MCP
   handshake and the server's database role reading `runtime.runs`. It does
   not prove a completed call: no single role can make up a claim and a run,
   so that is `make demo`'s proof. Before `make deploy` this check prints SKIP.
4. **Telemetry.** Three short Jobs run `telemetrygen` and send one trace, one
   log and one metric for a fresh service name (`meridian-smoke-<epoch>`)
   through the collector. The script then reads each back through Grafana's
   datasource proxy from Tempo, Loki and Prometheus, waiting up to 120 seconds
   each. It prints the trace ID and how to find the data in Grafana Explore.
5. **Cost panel.** Three lines. The dashboard: Grafana serves
   `meridian-gateway-cost` as provisioned, with the same queries as the
   file, and Prometheus runs each of them without an error. The gateway's
   series: when the gateway is available and its ledger holds an attempt
   settled since its process started, Prometheus must hold its tokens,
   cost and calls series with a sample exported after the first of those
   attempts, so that the series of a process that has just been replaced
   do not count. Before `make deploy`, and while the gateway has settled
   nothing since it started, this line prints SKIP; `make demo` sends a
   claim. Grafana's rights: its service account may not read Secrets in
   `meridian` or `observability`.

`make smoke` creates three Jobs in `observability`. Kubernetes removes each one
15 minutes after it finishes. The tool check leaves at most one refused
`tool.call` row per server in the audit log per throttle window.

## The services: `make deploy` and `make demo`

One image, built from the [`Dockerfile`](../../Dockerfile) at the repository
root, runs all six services and the three commands of the Jobs. It is based on
`python:3.13-slim` and `uv`, both pinned by digest, installs the locked
dependencies without the dev group and the package non-editable into a venv,
runs as user 10001 and sets no command of its own (each manifest names it).
It carries the registry and the seed data the Jobs load: the synthetic
policies, their claim history, the four policy wordings and the generator's
manifest (file hashes and counts), and nothing else of `data/synthetic`: not
the claims, not the expected outcomes. Every service's pod therefore holds
the policies file, with each synthetic holder's name and address, although
only the seed Job reads it (threat model T-51).
Its build context is an allowlist ([`.dockerignore`](../../.dockerignore)), so
the kubeconfig, `.env` files and `.context/` can never enter it; key and
certificate files are excluded even inside the allowed folders. There is no
registry: `make deploy` tags the image `meridian:<first 12 hex digits of its
ID>` and loads it into the kind node, so an unchanged tree reuses the same
tag.

| Service | Reached at | Database role |
|---|---|---|
| Claims API | `http://claims.meridian.localhost:8088` (edge) and `claims-api.meridian.svc:8000` | `claims_api` |
| Agent Runtime | `agent-runtime.meridian.svc:8000`, cluster only | `agent_runtime` |
| Model Gateway | `model-gateway.meridian.svc:8000`, cluster only | `model_gateway` |
| Policy tool server (`policy_lookup`, `claim_history`) | `policy-mcp.meridian.svc:8000/mcp`, cluster only | `policy_mcp` |
| Knowledge tool server (`wording_search`) | `knowledge-mcp.meridian.svc:8000/mcp`, cluster only | `knowledge_mcp` |
| Claims tool server (`add_claim_note`, `request_approval`; no graph calls them before S015) | `claims-mcp.meridian.svc:8000/mcp`, cluster only | `claims_mcp` |

The runtime finds the tool servers through `MERIDIAN_TOOL_SERVERS`, a map of
the registry's server IDs to those addresses. A tool server answers `/mcp`
only for the one Host name in its `MERIDIAN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, which is the name
in the runtime's map: the same Service called as
`policy-mcp.meridian.svc.cluster.local`, `policy-mcp.meridian` or `policy-mcp`
gets 421. A test keeps the two values equal.

In order, `make deploy`:

1. Refuses with "run 'make up' first" if the `meridian` Database is not
   applied, a role is not reconciled or a role Secret is missing.
2. Builds and loads the image.
3. Runs a Job `meridian-migrate-<tag>` with `meridian db migrate`, then a Job
   `meridian-seed-<tag>` with `meridian db seed-policies`, both as
   `meridian_owner`. Only the three Jobs read that Secret. Both must finish
   before anything else is applied; on failure the script prints the Job's
   log and exits non-zero. They run on every deploy (a Job of the same tag is
   deleted first; the runner skips what is applied and the seed mirrors its
   source, so a rerun takes seconds) and end after 300 seconds at most. The
   seed comes before the services because a claim that meets an empty policy
   table gets a stored proposal "policy not found", and a stored proposal is
   final.
4. Applies every other file in `manifests/meridian/` (found by glob: the
   ServiceAccounts, Deployments, Services, the HTTPRoute and the
   BackendTrafficPolicy). `@IMAGE@` (and `@TAG@` in a Job's name) are the
   only text it substitutes.
5. Waits for the Model Gateway, then runs a Job `meridian-ingest-<tag>` with
   `meridian knowledge ingest`, which embeds the 85 clauses of the four
   wordings through the gateway and replaces the knowledge store in one
   transaction. Once per image: the finished Job has no expiry and is the
   record that this image's corpus is in the store, so the next deploy of
   the same image skips it, after checking that the store is not empty. The
   Job is a record of what was done, not of what the store holds now: after
   an ingestion by hand from other files, delete the Job to ingest again. A
   search before the first ingestion fails its run (`no-corpus`), and that
   claim can simply be posted again.
6. Waits for the other rollouts and for the route to be `Accepted`.
7. After an ingestion, waits until a minute has passed since it finished.
   The ingestion's embedding calls go out under the `claims-triage` tenant,
   whose limits the registry sets: it reserved 7,679 of the tenant's 10,000
   tokens a minute and six of its ten requests per 10 seconds (measured on
   kind, 2026-10-02). A triage that asks the model reserves about 1,090
   tokens in five requests, so a claim posted in the first seconds would be
   refused, and only two would fit in that minute. The wait makes a deploy
   end with the limits clear. A deploy that is interrupted after the
   ingestion and run again within that minute does not wait. Whether
   ingestion should spend a workload's budget at all is an open registry
   decision (threat model T-60).

Each pod gets its own role's connection string from its Secret, and the
cluster CA's public certificate (`ca.crt` only, not the CA's private key that
shares the Secret `platform-db-ca`) at `/etc/meridian/db-ca/ca.crt`. Spans go
to the collector's OTLP/HTTP port, `:4318`; the `/healthz` probes are not
traced. The `*.localhost` name resolves to the loopback address on macOS and
on current Linux resolvers; the edge listens on `127.0.0.1` only.

The route is the whole boundary: the Claims API is the only service with one,
on the host `claims.meridian.localhost`. A request with any other `Host`
header, such as `127.0.0.1:8088` or a page that rebinds its DNS name to
loopback (threat model T-01), matches no route and gets 404 from Envoy.
Envoy buffers each request to the Claims API and answers 413 above 64 KiB, the
app's own limit, before the app sees it. TLS, NetworkPolicy and hardened
charts are S019.

A `ClusterIP` Service means unrouted, not protected: the Agent Runtime, the
Model Gateway and the tool servers have no route at the edge, but any pod in
the cluster can call them, over plain HTTP, until S019's NetworkPolicy lands.
A tool server gives such a caller less than the others do: it answers only
for the run ID of a running run and only with that run's claim (T-50). The
database boundary above does not depend on any of that.

`make demo` posts the claims in `data/synthetic/claims.json` in order to the
Claims API through the edge, with a W3C `traceparent` header whose trace ID the
script made up. A claim that already has a triage proposal answers 409 and the
script moves on to the next one, so each run uses the next claim (40 are
available); it stops at the first 201. It prints the claim ID, the status, the
route and the deployment the model call went to, or that no model was called
(never a claimant field, and not the reason: the answer does not carry it),
then reads the trace by that ID from Tempo through Grafana's datasource proxy,
retrying for up to 120 seconds. It prints PASS only if the trace has spans from
`claims-api`, `agent-runtime`, `policy-mcp`, `knowledge-mcp` and
`model-gateway`, with the span count of each, and exits non-zero otherwise.
Every triage of a claim whose policy exists touches the five: the graph looks
up the policy and its claim history, then searches the wording, and each
search embeds its query through the gateway even when the rules decide and
the model is never asked. `make grafana` shows the trace in Explore with the
TraceQL query `{ trace:id = "<id>" }`.

## The cost dashboard

`make grafana`, then Dashboards, **Meridian: Model Gateway tokens and cost**
(S043). It shows the gateway's tokens, cost and calls for the selected time
range: three totals, tokens and cost broken down by tenant, agent, provider
or model (a selector at the top), a table by all four, and tokens per five
minutes by model. The file is
[`dashboards/gateway-cost.json`](dashboards/gateway-cost.json); edit it
there and rerun `make up`, because Grafana does not save changes made in
its editor to a provisioned dashboard. `make up` also removes the
ConfigMap of a dashboard whose file is gone.

What the numbers are, which the dashboard also says on its first panel:

- **Answered attempts only.** Tokens and cost count what a provider
  answered, with the provider's own token counts and the registry's prices.
  The ledger, table `gateway.usage`, is the record of what a tenant was
  charged, including a reservation kept after a failed attempt.
- **Cost reads 0 on kind.** The simulated `replay` deployments are priced at
  zero in the registry; cost is above zero only on a route to a priced
  deployment.
- **No `increase()` or `rate()`.** A gateway process exports its counters
  once a minute over OTLP, and its first export already carries what it
  counted, so `increase()` reported 0 for 17,319 ingestion tokens on this
  cluster. Each panel subtracts a series' value at the start of the range
  (zero for a process that started inside it) from its last value. Measured
  on 2026-10-03 over 12 hours, every panel and breakdown equalled the
  ledger: 18,512 tokens, 37 calls, EUR 0.
- Choose a range of at least two minutes; a shorter one can hold no export.

## If `make up` was interrupted

Rerunning `make up` is the first thing to try. If a release is stuck in a
`pending-*` state, or the node was only half created, run `make down` and then
`make up` again.

If `make up` times out waiting for the Gateway to be programmed and
`kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system get gateway edge` shows `AddressNotAssigned`,
Envoy Gateway did not pick up the node's address (seen on 2026-10-01 on a
cluster that had run for 18 hours; the edge served routes anyway). Restart the
controller, wait for it, then touch the Gateway:

```sh
K="kubectl --kubeconfig infra/kind/kubeconfig --context kind-meridian -n envoy-gateway-system"
$K rollout restart deploy/envoy-gateway
$K rollout status deploy/envoy-gateway
$K annotate gateway edge meridian.local/reconcile-nudge="$(date -u +%FT%TZ)" --overwrite
```

## Ports

| Address | What |
|---|---|
| `127.0.0.1:8088` | The edge (Envoy), from kind's `extraPortMappings` to node port 30080. Loopback only. |
| `127.0.0.1:3000` | Grafana, only while `make grafana` runs. |

Grafana is deliberately not behind the gateway (threat model T-03). It has
sign-in, sign-up is off, anonymous access is off. Its admin password is
generated once by `make up` into the Secret `grafana-admin` and is never
written to a file or printed by any script except `make grafana-password`.

## Using kubectl and helm

The cluster's credentials are in `infra/kind/kubeconfig` (gitignored). The
scripts never touch `~/.kube/config`, never rely on the current context, and
never run `helm repo add`. To work by hand:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/infra/kind/kubeconfig
kubectl get pods -A
```

## Memory

The laptop this was built on gives Docker Desktop 7.65 GiB. The memory limits
of the components add up to about 4.4 GiB. Measured with `docker stats` on the
node container on 2026-09-30, after a `make up` from no cluster, a second
`make up` and one `make smoke`: 3.6 GiB, which includes the Kubernetes control
plane, the kubelet and containerd. The six Meridian services add limits of
192 MiB (Claims API, Model Gateway) and 256 MiB (Agent Runtime and each tool
server), 1.4 GiB in all; a Job adds 192 MiB while it runs. Measured from
cAdvisor on 2026-10-02, twice, after demo claims and smoke runs: the working
sets were 54 to 115 MB (the runtime the largest, the tool servers 72 to
87 MB), and `docker stats` showed 4.9 GiB for the node container.

## Deliberately not here yet

- TLS on the gateway, NetworkPolicy, PodDisruptionBudgets, read-only root
  filesystems and Helm charts for the Meridian services: S019.
- Alertmanager: S024. Its Grafana datasource is off too.
- Persistence beyond the node: PostgreSQL, Loki and Tempo use small volumes on
  the node's disk, Prometheus and Grafana use none. `make down` removes all of
  it.
- Scraping of etcd, controller-manager, scheduler and kube-proxy is off: kind
  does not expose them to the cluster.
- Helm installs the CRDs a chart ships in its `crds/` folder but never
  upgrades them. A chart bump that changes CRDs needs them applied by hand.
